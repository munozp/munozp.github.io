<h2>Bio</h2>
    
<p>
<i>"A Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"</i> - Lao Tzu. As usually, my journey starts standing on the shoulders of my parents. They gave me the opportunity to complete a degree in Engineer in Computer Science (2009) and a masters in Space Technology and Science (2010) at the <a href="https://www.uah.es" target="_blank">University of Alcalá</a>. Then, I started to walk with my PhD advisor, <a href="https://atc1.aut.uah.es/~mdolores" target="_blank">Dr. María Dolores Rodríguez Moreno</a>, purshing a PhD in autonomous robots funded by the <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA" target="_blank">ESA</a> NPI programme project "Cooperative Systems for Autonomous Exploration Missions". Sometimes my trip took me to Rome, where I was able to learn important lessons (yes Amedeo, I did) from my co-advisor, <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/people/amedeo-cesta" target="_blank">Dr. Amedeo Cesta</a>, and the <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/group/pst" target="_blank">PST team</a> (with special thanks to <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/people/andrea-orlandini" target="_blank">Dr. Andrea Orlandini</a>). That part of the travel had slopes, frustrations and wins, culminating with my PhD defense on November 2016 in the Space Technology program.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in boring data, during my PhD I supervised undergraduate and masters students, helped with teaching, participated in projects proposal writing (for Spanish calls, FP7, H2020 and ESA ITTs), worked in different projects as a member of the <a href="http://isg.aut.uah.es" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems Group</a>, I was part of the organizing committee of 2 international congresses and reviewer for various conferences and journals and as result of my research I published several <a href="">journal</a> and <a href="">conference</a> papers.
</p>

<p>
However, not everything is about what I did. I think it is also relevant to mention the people with which I did it. Most of them are members or former members of the ISG group (Bonifacio, David, Fernando, Dani, Diego or Yoli) but also friends and family (yes sister). All of them allowed me to grown in different ways and learn about different topics. In this regard, I learned some good lessons about me: I work better in a large room with coffee and good people around me, I hate cable messes (I am very tidy), I do not see problems, only solutions (unless there is no milk for the coffee) and I am not a morning person. 
</p>

<p>
My research interests are focused on autonomous robots from a high level perspective, considering decision systems (such as Planning & Scheduling) and hierarchical tasks descriptions. I specially focus my work towards space missions, but some of my assets can be applied to closer problems, for instance, telecare, surveillance or package delivery robots. Also, I like to work in other areas related to the Artificial Intelligence, applying new solutions to solve specific problems, for example, using Machine Learning techniques for a quality control service in industrial processes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Currently</b>, I am working for the <a href="http://stcorp.nl" target="_blank">Science [&] Technology Corporation</a> in Delft (The Netherlands) as scientific employee, working in the <a href="https://www.cerbero-h2020.eu" target="_blank">H2020 CERBERO</a> project. Particularly, my role is to enhance a previous decision support system (MECA) for its application to a smart travelling scenario with an electric car. Previously, I worked as a researcher at the University of Alcalá (post and pre-doctoral), participating in several research and industrial projects (one as PI). Looking more in the past, I worked as helpdesk and IT technician and my first job was basketball referee (I love this game!).
